Reshaping the data\n","CNNs expect the data to be in a specific shape depending on the number of dimensions. Since we work with image data, we will use 2D CNN layers. The expected shape that would be as follows (number_of_samples, dimension_size_1, dimension_size_2, channel). Looking at X_train. The shape above the first 3 is easy to derive. The number of training samples is 60000 and the images are 28*28 and therefore those would be the two dimension sizes. Channel would basically be the number of spectral wavelengths are in the data. For colored images this is 3 (red, green, blue) for greyscale images this would just be 1, and for multispectral satellite images, this could be many more. In this case, we have black and white images, so we end up with the desired X_train shape of (60000,28,28,1). This is not the shape of our data as can be seen above, that would be (60000,28,28). This is because it has the intensity value in the second dimension instead of it being just a coordinate and an extra dimension for the intensity.

This means that when you stack too many layers and/or use large kernel sizes, the image at some point will become smaller than 0x0 resulting in a crash.
