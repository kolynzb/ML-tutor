One-hot encoding means that we convert the target label into a binary vector where the length of the vector is the same size as the number of categories and we encode a class by keeping all scalars in the vector 0 except for the class that we want to encode which is 1. In other words, only one of the 10 values in the array can be 1 while all others are 0 and the location of the 1 represents the number in the class. so 4 becomes [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n","\n","We sadly do not have time to go into detail on why this is and how you should go about this. SKlearn's LaberBinarizer below will do the trick for you. For those that are curious, you encode classes in an array because when you use a single number the neural network will assume that class 1 is closer to class 2 than to class 7. Think of it as classifying pictures of animals, the networks would think that class 1 (dog) is closer to class 2 (horse) than to class 8 (cat).

When you feel adventurous you can change these but for this exercise, we advise keeping those set. [Here you find all available layers and activation functions in Keras](https://keras.io/api/layers/). The first number in each layer defines the number of neurons in the layer and with that the limit of the amount of information that layer can pass to the next. The first layer is called the input layer, here you will need to define the shape of data it should be expecting. Based on this it can determine how many incoming connections each neuron will need. The Last Dense layer should compress the influx of data to the number of classes that exist, therefore the number of neurons should equal the number of classes. In the case of classification, the activation function should determine the choice your model is making. You can choose from several activation functions or even create your own, but when doing classification SoftMax is generally used.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"c8z30uGVB1eK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tensorflow import keras\n","\n","def define_model(input_shape, num_classes):\n","    # Build the architecture\n","    model = keras.Sequential(\n","        [\n","            keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=\"relu\", input_shape=input_shape),\n","            keras.layers.Dense(32, activation=\"relu\"),\n","            keras.layers.Dense(16, activation=\"relu\"),\n","            keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=\"softmax\"),\n","        ]\n","    )\n","\n","    print(model.summary())\n","    return model"],"metadata":{"id":"FKCxNeMrB2Do","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1639746931286,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":202,"user":{"displayName":"Dorian Groen","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgFSSbFWDsn6WUrUvMWj7grmKzhicr33AwzYcQA=s64","userId":"03939438735533490244"}}},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Training the network\n","When training a model we need to define the number of epochs it will run for.
