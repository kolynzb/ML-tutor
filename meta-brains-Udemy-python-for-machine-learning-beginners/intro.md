## What is Machine Learning

## Supervised VS Unsupervised Learning

## Python Libraries used

- **NumPy** - Helps deal with large, multidimensional arrays and matrices,along with large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **SciPy** - Used for computing and technical computing.SciPy contains modiles for optimization,linear algebra, intergration, special and image processing, and other tasks common in science and engineering.
- **Matplotlib** - Is a plotting library,and it is easy to use with Numpy because its numeric is integrated with Numpy.
- **Pandas** - Is Designed for data manipulation and analysis.In paticular , it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- **SciKitLearn** (sklearn) - is a free software machine learning library for python programming language. It features various classification,regression and clustering algorithms.And it is designed to interoperate with the python numerical and scientific libraries Numpy and SciPy.
