# Introduction To Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning

## Supervised VS Unsupervised Learning

## Python Libraries used
- __NumPy__ - Helps deal with large, multidimensional arrays and matrices,along with large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- __SciPy__ - Used for computing and technical computing.SciPy contains modiles for optimization,linear algebra, intergration, special and image processing, and other tasks common in science and engineering.
- __Matplotlib__ - Is a plotting library,and it is easy to use with Numpy because its numeric is integrated with Numpy.
- __Pandas__ - Is Designed for data manipulation and analysis.In paticular , it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
