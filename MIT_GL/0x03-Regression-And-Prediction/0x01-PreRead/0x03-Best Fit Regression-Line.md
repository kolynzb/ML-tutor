## Best Fit Regression Line

### **Best Linear Prediction**

Without getting into detailed statistical calculations, a thumb rule in getting a decent linear regression model is to fit the line that passes through the space that minimizes the distance of each of the independent variable data points from the straight line. This method of estimation is called ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. Suppose we are looking at a single X variable, the scatter plot (plot of Y vs X as data points) provides visual clues about the spread of the data points and the approximate trend between X and Y.

To manually fit a regression line, one has to visualize the line that passes through the points such that the distance of each point from the line is the minimum. Once the line is drawn (say on a graph paper), one can easily calculate the intercept and the slope as approximate (crude) coefficients for the regression model. An intuitive best-fit line on a scatterplot would look something like this.
