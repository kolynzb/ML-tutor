### **Linear vs Non-Linear Models**

Each term in a linear regression model is either a constant or a product of a parameter (regression coefficient) and an independent variable.

For example: `𝑌̂= β0+ β1*X1+ β2*X2+ ......βn*Xn`.

This is said to be a regression model that is linear in its parameters. Any regression model that does not follow the rules for a linear regression model is non-linear.

For example: 𝑌̂= tanh(β0+ β1*X1+ β2*X2) is a non-linear model.

### **Parametric vs Non-Parametric Models**

A parametric model is obtained based on certain assumptions about the distribution of the data that is being modelled. Because of the assumptions, the model is characterized by a finite set of parameters (or coefficients). For example, there are both linear and non-linear regressions that are parametric models. A non-parametric model on the other hand does not make any assumptions about the nature of the data and does not have a fixed set of coefficients that define the model. This kind of model is extremely flexible compared to the parametric one in terms of assumptions.
