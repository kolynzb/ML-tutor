The tools and techniques developed in the previous module allowed us to take a peek at large and unstructured data. Now that we have got a better handle on what this kind of data looks like and what information it contains, a natural question is “Can we use it to make predictions?”. The need to formulate predictions from data can arise in a variety of contexts, whether we are trying to predict future data or simply data that is hard or expensive to collect in the future but was available in the past. The general idea behind the prediction is to analyze data to identify an input/output function. This course, “Regression and Prediction”, will cover many techniques for this task. Specifically, we will discuss:

Linear and non-linear regression together with their extensions, as well as causal inference, where the goal is to understand the effects of actively manipulating a variable as opposed to passively measuring it.
Modern regression with high-dimensional data, which is akin to finding a needle in a haystack: for large datasets, it becomes necessary to sort out which variables are relevant for prediction and which are not. Recent years have witnessed the development of new statistical techniques, such as Lasso or Random Forests, that are computationally scalable to large datasets, and which automatically select relevant data.
This module is taught by Prof. Victor Chernozhukov, from the MIT Department of Economics, and the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (MIT IDSS). Prof. Chernozhukov’s expertise covers econometrics, machine learning, and statistics, in which he has developed fundamental methodology particularly to deal with high-dimensional data. This module not only covers a description of the methodology involved in Regression and Prediction but also a mathematical introduction to its underlying principles.

 

Goals
1. An understanding of basic regression for prediction and inferential purposes
