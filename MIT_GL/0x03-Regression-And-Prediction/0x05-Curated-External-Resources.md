## Curated External Resources - Regression and Prediction

The following articles should give you a good understanding of concepts and ideas from regression:

1. **[Linear Regression (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/linear-regression-for-machine-learning):** This article explains the linear regression algorithm along with the underlying assumptions. It talks about the various performance measures used to evaluate the model.
2. **[Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://brilliant.org/wiki/maximum-likelihood-estimation-mle/):** This article explains the concept of maximum likelihood estimation and why it is used in machine learning with the help of examples.
3. [**Empirical Risk Minimization:** (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://prateekvjoshi.com/2017/08/19/what-is-empirical-risk-minimization/) This article gives an intuition behind empirical risk minimization.
4. **[Assumptions of Linear Regression (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://www.jmp.com/en_us/statistics-knowledge-portal/what-is-regression/simple-linear-regression-assumptions.html):** This article talks about certain assumptions that we make before applying linear regression with the help of visual analysis.
5. **[Regularization (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://analyticsindiamag.com/regularization-in-machine-learning-a-detailed-guide/):** This article explains the concept of regularization and its types. Regularization is used to avoid overfitting by adding some coefficients in the loss function equation.
6. **[Cross-Validation](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/cross-validation/):** This article explains the concept of cross-validation, its types, and why it is used in machine learning. It discusses the steps taken while applying cross-validation techniques.
7. **[Bootstrap Sampling (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-bootstrap-method/#:~:text=The%20bootstrap%20method%20is%20a,sampling%20a%20dataset%20with%20replacement.&text=It%20is%20used%20in%20applied,included%20in%20the%20training%20data.):** This article talks about the bootstrap sampling method in machine learning and why we need it, along with its implementation in Python.
