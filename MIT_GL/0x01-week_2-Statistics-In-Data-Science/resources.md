# Curated External Resources - Statistics for Data Science-2

- Here are some of the curated books and articles for you to go through:

- [Prem S. Mann â€¢ Introductory Statistics, Seventh Edition](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyY2hzdGF0MTIxfGd4OjdkMzA1MDQ1ZGM0YjMyOTg) - This book covers the basics of statistics using real-life examples, exercises, and precise presentation. You don't need to have a high-level knowledge of mathematics or statistics to go through this book. You can go through the listed chapters to develop a good understanding of the basic statistics.
  - Chapter 1: Introduction
  - Chapter 3: Numerical Descriptive Measures
  - Chapter 4: Probability
- [Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers](https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/thinkstats.pdf) - Think Stats is a short book that emphasizes simple techniques that can be used to explore real data sets and answer interesting questions. It shows how to perform statistical analysis computationally, rather than mathematically, with programs written in Python.
- [Probability Distributions](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/probability-distributions/) - This article covers the concept of a probability distribution, and what are its general properties for different types of distributions - Discrete and Continuous, in easy-to-understand terminology.
- [CLT Demonstration](https://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/) - This is an interactive simulation that lets you explore various aspects of sampling distributions. It can be used to demonstrate Central Limit Theorem.
- [Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests](http://www.mit.edu/~6.s085/notes/lecture2.pdf) - This chapter covers the concept of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
