DescriptION
Welcome to the project on Foundations of Data Science. In this project, we aim to analyze diabetes data and address some important business problems/questions.
This project is focused on Exploratory Data Analysis
A solution notebook is shared for the analysis
Many parts of the solution notebook are omitted and replaced with questions. You are expected to fill in the gaps as per the instructions/questions.
 

Problem Statement:
Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Diabetes Analysis by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.

 

Data Dictionary:
Below is the attribute information:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)
 

Best Practices for Notebook
The notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights.
The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner before submission.
It is preferable to remove all warnings and errors before submission.
The notebook should be submitted as an HTML file (.html) and NOT as a notebook file (.ipynb).
 

Submission Guidelines
The submission should be a well-commented Jupyter notebook [format - .html]
Any assignment found copied/ plagiarized with other groups will not be graded and awarded zero marks.
Please ensure timely submission as any submission post-deadline will not be accepted for evaluation.
Submission will not be evaluated if
the code blocks are not executed,
it is submitted post-deadline, or,
more than 1 file is submitted.
 

Happy Learning!
