# Course Outline
Nowadays, nearly everything in our lives can be quantified by data. Whether it involves search engine results, social media usage, weather trackers, cars, or sports, data is always being collected to enhance our quality of life. How can we use all of this raw data to improve our performance?

The answer is found in this opening module!

This module will introduce us to the tools and techniques developed to make sense of unstructured data and discover hidden patterns. Specifically, the main topics covered are:

1. Supervised & Unsupervised Learning and the main techniques corresponding to each one (Classification and Clustering, respectively)

2. An in-depth look at the K-Means Clustering algorithm

3. Dimensionality Reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE)

Goals
1. An understanding of the many different techniques used to discover patterns in a dataset

2. Knowledge of when to use each of the above techniques based on the given information

3. An in-depth understanding of the K-Means Clustering algorithm and Dimensionality Reduction techniques from Unsupervised Learning

Objectives
At the end of this module you will be able to:

1. Understand the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning 

2. Understand when and how to apply clustering techniques

3. Understand how the K-Means Clustering algorithm works and how to implement it

4. Understand what Principal Component Analysis is and how to compute it using eigenvectors

5. Understand how t-SNE helps us identify groupings in our data
