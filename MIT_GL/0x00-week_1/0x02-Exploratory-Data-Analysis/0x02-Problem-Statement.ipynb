The market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics. The team decides to collect data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at a CardioGood Fitness retail store at any time in the past three months. The data is stored in the `CardioGoodFitness.csv` file.\n",
