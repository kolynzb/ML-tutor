# Graph Theory

- **Graph Theory** is the study of graphical structures that model relations between two variables or objects. Structurally, graphs are merely a collection of nodes inter-connected by edges in various ways.

- Graphs are used by various algorithms in machine learning to perform tasks like clustering, classification, and regression.

- A graph is usually represented using nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links).

- Mathematically, graphs are sometimes represented as:

`G = (V,E)`

- where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

- Graphs can either be directed or undirected.

- In an undirected graph, the path between 2 nodes is merely a connection between them, and has no inherent source/target, while in a directed graph, every edge is a clear path from one node to another.
