# PCA
- We should always use the correlation matrix when we have different units in different entries because the correlation matrix normalizes the directions of variables so that all of them carry the same weight. Using the correlation matrix is equivalent to standardizing each of the variables (to mean 0 and standard deviation 1).

# T-SNE
