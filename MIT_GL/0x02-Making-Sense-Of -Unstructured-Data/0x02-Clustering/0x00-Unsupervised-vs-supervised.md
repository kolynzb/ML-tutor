## K means Preliminaries

- Every machine learning method has assumptions that are taken in to consideration before application.
- More generally you can have a huge number of feature know as feature D (_this is quite similar to n in math_)

# PCA

- We should always use the correlation matrix when we have different units in different entries because the correlation matrix normalizes the directions of variables so that all of them carry the same weight. Using the correlation matrix is equivalent to standardizing each of the variables (to mean 0 and standard deviation 1).

PCA is a technique used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. It operates on numerical data, such as frequency counts or numerical features. In the given code, the frequency tables represent the counts of specific letter combinations, which can be used as features for further analysis or modeling. If you intend to perform PCA on the frequency tables, you would typically apply the PCA algorithm separately using libraries like scikit-learn.
